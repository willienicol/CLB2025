    "Okay students. Most of you completed CBI 310 and are familiar with the SLUMBAG project on anaerobic digestion. For those who still need to take CBI 310, the project focuses on developing an affordable biogas (cooking gas) system from organic waste for African informal settlements. We're currently prototyping this on the UP experimental farm using an 800L digester bag partially buried in the ground. Here is a picture of the the 'big babies':\n",

    "<img src=\"pic2.png\" width=\"850\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "One major challenge in prototype development is temperature control. Since townships lack electricity, solar energy is our only heat source. Consequently, the critical question is whether sufficient biogas can be produced during winter. Our analysis indicates that sustained digestion requires an average daily temperature ‚â•22¬∞C. July's average air temperature is approximately 11¬∞C ‚Äì making solar heat capture essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll assist by studying a full-scale water-based thermal model of the digester at the UP experimental farm. All temperature data will be logged remotely, with your primary focus on data modeling, interpretation, and winter operational projections. Note: You'll need to visit the farm (5 minutes from campus) for equipment familiarization and to induce a thermal step-change during your 10-day data collection period.\n",

    "Note that $k_1$ is the thermal conductivity of the soil. The $\\Delta L$ can be approximated as 0.4m for a start, but take this parameter as a fitted parameter. The heat transfer between the liquid-gas interface is given by $h_1$ another fitted paramenter. To convert the illuminance to actual heat input into the liquid use the paramenter $a$. This parameter will incorporate the net energy absorbtion into the liquid. Lastly you can extend your model to incorporate the condensation/evaporation occuring. The $\\lambda$ parameter is the rate of evaporation/consensation. To determine this you can assume that the gas is saturated with water at all times, so higher temperatures will force evaporation and you will be able to calculate the mass of liquid converting into vapour per time or the vapour turning into liquid depending on the time of day. We assume that the amount of condensation/evaporation is very small compared to $m_D$ and that $m_D$ remains relatively constant. **Only include evaporation and condensation into the model if you have solved and fitted the model without the $\\lambda \\Delta H_{vap}$ term**  "
