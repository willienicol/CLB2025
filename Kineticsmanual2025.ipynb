Add the NaoH first and obtain the EC reading before adding the ethyl acetate. Monitor this reaction with your second probe for the first 60 minutes. You will require a stabilised reading at the end of this run to determine the parameters required to infer concentration from EC (see below). \n",
    "\n",
    "The pump should be set to 5ml/min (for each tube) for the first 60 minutes and 10ml/min thereafter. This implies that the total flow rate to the first CSTR is 10ml/min for the first hour and 20ml/min for the second part of experiment. **The flow to the second CSTR will only commence after 60 min.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The experiment will start with the beaker filled with 70 ml of distilled water (almost zero electrical conductivity). Ensure to monitor conductivity as the beaker fills and starts overflowing into the exit tube. Note that we switch for semi-batch to continuous when the overflow commences. After 60 min you will connect the outflow to the second CSTR (initially filled with 150ml of distilled water) and set the pump to 10ml/min for both feeds. From 60 min you will also monitor the conductivity of the second probe in the second vessel  \n",

    "Given that both reagent flows get mixed into the CSTR the inlet concentration to the first CSTR will be 0.02 mol/L of NaOH (reagent A) and 0.04 mol/l of ethyl acetate (reagent B) at all times. The EC (electrical conductivity) measurements in the reactor will be recorded at regular time intervals as time progresses.\n",
